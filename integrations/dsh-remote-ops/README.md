# @dsh/remote-ops

Standalone DeepSeek Harness plugin for remote Linux operations. It does not
depend on or start the myterm desktop application.

## Capabilities

- Environment groups persisted as `remote-ops/environments/<group>/environments.<group>.json`.
- The right Sidebar uses a narrow navigation rail, a hideable environment drawer, a persistent SSH terminal, and a quick-command dock below the terminal.
- Environments and quick commands support manual create, edit, delete, and group management; non-empty groups cannot be deleted.
- Owner-scoped SSH sessions backed by the Harness `ctx.terminals` service.
- A local CMD terminal starts with the plugin at `$DSH_HOME/remote-ops`, before an Agent is initialized. It accepts ordinary local commands and interactive `ssh`; saved-environment SSH sessions fall back to this terminal after disconnecting.
- Complete command submission, direct terminal keyboard input, signals, and retained output; Tab completion, arrows, backspace, Enter, and Ctrl+C are forwarded as terminal keys.
- SSH sessions request a UTF-8 locale and the UI removes ANSI control sequences; the backend accepts UTF-8, GB18030, Big5, and related terminal encodings.
- A lightweight VT screen model applies ConPTY clear, cursor, line-rewrite, and scroll operations, avoiding blank screen snapshots while keeping the final line reachable through a stable scrollbar.
- Cursor-based output deltas use long polling and serialized batched keyboard writes, so idle terminals no longer transfer complete snapshots or generate frequent empty requests.
- Sequential multi-target execution for observe-then-continue workflows.
- SFTP list, read, write, mkdir, delete, and rename operations.
- Quick command storage and execution.
- Agent-visible diagnostics and a native DSH right-sidebar tab.
- A visible `Remote Ops` launch button in the DSH Web sidebar footer; it opens
  the right Sidebar without waiting for an Agent tool call.
- The Sidebar header shows the installed plugin version, checks the latest
  GitHub Release, and can install an update with one click; refresh and update
  actions expose loading/success/failure feedback. Restart DSH after the package
  manager finishes.
- The quick-command dock can be resized by dragging its top boundary (double-click
  to restore the default height). The environment form hides the internal Harness
  credential reference; SSH passwords are stored through the Harness credentials service.
- Connection errors remain visible until dismissed; credential references through Harness credentials and plaintext passwords are
  never persisted.

## Installation

Install the release tarball with the official DSH plugin manager. The
`dsh.bundle.patch` declaration activates the bundle automatically; do not copy
the patch into the profile by hand.

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add ./dsh-remote-ops-v0.2.19.tgz
dsh web
```

For a package obtained from a registry, the package name is:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add @dsh/remote-ops
```

The GitHub release asset is the canonical artifact for this repository. A
local checkout can also be packed with `npm pack` and installed with the same
command.

The plugin is a pure DeepSeek Harness plugin and this repository no longer
contains the myterm desktop application. It works in DSH hosts that provide the
documented Agent, terminal, tools, system-prompt, credentials, and connection
services. SSH PTYs are process-local by design; saved environment definitions
survive restarts and reconnect on demand.

After DSH Web starts, click `Remote Ops` in the sidebar footer to open the
right Sidebar while keeping the current conversation visible. The button never
starts a fallback conversation; if the Sidebar service is not ready, the plugin
retries and reports the exact failure. SSH and SFTP actions remain owned by the
selected Harness session.

## Interactive Workspace

- Enter reuses an existing connection or offers a chooser; the separate plus action opens a new connection (maximum three per environment and owner). Inspect owner/activity and release individual connections. Hosts exposing `sessionController.resolveAgent` can resume a saved session without a model prompt; an unsaved draft is not an SSH owner.
- Manual input holds the terminal until explicitly returned to the Agent. Takeover, stop-wait, Ctrl+C and connection release are separate operations. The Agent receives `TERMINAL_MANUAL_CONTROL` instead of interleaved input. Adopted backends that cannot stop a wait without interruption report that limitation.
- Quick commands have a multiline editor, explicit target and input preview. Multiline paste requires confirmation. Search/copy, font size, wrapping and quick-dock height are available; browser preferences persist. The outer Sidebar width remains owned by Harness.
- Both file panes independently select the DSH host or an SSH environment. Browser upload/download refers to the browser device. Files and directories can be selected together; SSH-to-SSH copies stream through the DSH host. Upload/download no longer buffer entire files or impose a 2 MiB limit.
- Transfers report bytes/files, cancellation and error/skip/overwrite conflict policies. Tool overwrite requires `overwrite: true`. Two jobs run concurrently, at most 20 are pending/running and 50 recent records are kept. Jobs are not resumed across restarts. Cancellation removes incomplete staging files, not already completed files/directories. Symlinks/devices are not followed; traversal is limited to depth 32 and 10,000 entries. Remote overwrite requires the atomic rename extension.
- Errors retain phase, code and original causes. Diagnostic export previews a metadata whitelist without credentials, command text, host addresses or terminal content.

## Data Storage

The plugin stores its own data under `$DSH_HOME/remote-ops`:

- `environments/<group>/environments.<group>.json` for environment definitions.
- `quick-commands/<group>/commands.<group>.json` for reusable commands.

Use a Harness credential reference such as `passwordRef` for passwords. The
Sidebar form also accepts an SSH password and stores it through
`credentials.set`; the environment JSON keeps only the reference. A private
key may be referenced by local path.

## Agent tools

Version 0.2.19 exposes environment list/create/update/delete, group management,
terminal
open/send/read/signal/close, multi-target batch execution, quick-command list
and run, SFTP operations, and diagnostics. The system-prompt contribution tells
the model to send a complete command when it is known and to use incremental
terminal feedback only when the current CLI state is genuinely uncertain.

Use `session: "local-cmd"` for the plugin's shared visible local terminal,
not the Harness built-in bash/pwsh tool. For SSH, reuse an explicit session
from the environment list. Sending by environment reuses a unique connection;
multiple connections require an explicit session id.

`remote_terminal_send` waits for fresh output and returns `output`,
`submittedText`, `submit`, `streamId`, `startOffset`, `nextOffset`, `endOffset`,
`hasMore`, `reset`, and `truncated`. The default output page is 16,384 UTF-16
code units, with surrogate pairs kept intact. Old viewport history is omitted
unless `includeViewport: true` is requested. To continue without typing:

```json
{"session":"local-cmd","cursor":546,"streamId":"<streamId from send/read>","waitMs":20000}
```

Pass that object to `remote_terminal_read`, replacing the cursor with the
previous `nextOffset`. Drain `hasMore` before waiting. Omit the cursor for
recent history; explicit `offset`/`count` selects backward line history.
`reset`/`truncated` signals replaced or expired history. Tool output is the
raw terminal stream, including control sequences; the UI renders that stream
through its VT model. A running shell, silence (`inferred_idle`), and timeout
do not prove command completion or success: `completion` remains `unknown`.
Observe actual results before dependent commands. Cancellation interrupts the
foreground process; a wait timeout alone does not kill it.

The terminal status bar reports transport and Agent binding, not an Agent
read receipt. Enlarged icon controls have tooltips. The quick-command dock
starts collapsed; reading history is preserved across SFTP switches, and new
output offers a jump to the latest line without taking over the scroll position.

The client dependency on `sidebarRight` and `sidebarRightTabs` is optional at
activation time. On older or non-Web DSH profiles the plugin no longer blocks
boot; the Sidebar UI attaches automatically when those services become
available.
