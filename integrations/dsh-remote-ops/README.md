# @dsh/remote-ops

Standalone DeepSeek Harness plugin for remote Linux operations. It does not
depend on or start the myterm desktop application.

## Capabilities

- Environment groups persisted as `remote-ops/environments/<group>/environments.<group>.json`.
- The right Sidebar uses a narrow navigation rail, a hideable environment drawer, a persistent SSH terminal, and a quick-command dock below the terminal.
- Environments and quick commands support manual create, edit, delete, and group management; non-empty groups cannot be deleted.
- Owner-scoped SSH sessions backed by the Harness `ctx.terminals` service.
- A local CMD terminal starts with the plugin at `$DSH_HOME/remote-ops`, before an Agent is initialized. It accepts ordinary local commands and interactive `ssh`; saved-environment SSH sessions fall back to this terminal after disconnecting.
- Complete command submission, direct terminal keyboard input, signals, and retained output; Tab completion, arrows, backspace, Enter, and Ctrl+C are forwarded as terminal keys.
- SSH sessions request a UTF-8 locale and the UI removes ANSI control sequences; the backend accepts UTF-8, GB18030, Big5, and related terminal encodings.
- A lightweight VT screen model applies ConPTY clear, cursor, line-rewrite, and scroll operations, avoiding blank screen snapshots while keeping the final line reachable through a stable scrollbar.
- Cursor-based output deltas use long polling and serialized batched keyboard writes, so idle terminals no longer transfer complete snapshots or generate frequent empty requests.
- Sequential multi-target execution for observe-then-continue workflows.
- SFTP list, read, write, mkdir, delete, and rename operations.
- Quick command storage and execution.
- Agent-visible diagnostics and a native DSH right-sidebar tab.
- A visible `Remote Ops` launch button in the DSH Web sidebar footer; it opens
  the right Sidebar without waiting for an Agent tool call.
- The Sidebar header shows the installed plugin version, checks the latest
  GitHub Release, and can install an update with one click; refresh and update
  actions expose loading/success/failure feedback. Restart DSH after the package
  manager finishes.
- The quick-command dock can be resized by dragging its top boundary (double-click
  to restore the default height). The environment form hides the internal Harness
  credential reference; SSH passwords are stored through the Harness credentials service.
- Connection errors remain visible until dismissed; credential references through Harness credentials and plaintext passwords are
  never persisted.

## Installation

Install the release tarball with the official DSH plugin manager. The
`dsh.bundle.patch` declaration activates the bundle automatically; do not copy
the patch into the profile by hand.

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add ./dsh-remote-ops-v0.2.20.tgz
dsh web
```

For a package obtained from a registry, the package name is:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add @dsh/remote-ops
```

The GitHub release asset is the canonical artifact for this repository. A
local checkout can also be packed with `npm pack` and installed with the same
command.

The plugin is a pure DeepSeek Harness plugin and this repository no longer
contains the myterm desktop application. It works in DSH hosts that provide the
documented Agent, terminal, tools, system-prompt, credentials, and connection
services. SSH PTYs are process-local by design; saved environment definitions
survive restarts and reconnect on demand.

After DSH Web starts, click `Remote Ops` in the sidebar footer to open the
right Sidebar while keeping the current conversation visible. The button never
starts a fallback conversation; if the Sidebar service is not ready, the plugin
retries and reports the exact failure. SSH and SFTP actions remain owned by the
selected Harness session.

## Interactive Workspace

- Enter reuses an existing connection or offers a chooser; the separate plus action opens a new connection (maximum three per environment and owner). Inspect owner/activity and release individual connections. Hosts exposing `sessionController.resolveAgent` can resume a saved session without a model prompt; an unsaved draft is not an SSH owner.
- Manual input holds the terminal until explicitly returned to the Agent. Takeover, stop-wait, Ctrl+C and connection release are separate operations. The Agent receives `TERMINAL_MANUAL_CONTROL` instead of interleaved input. Adopted backends that cannot stop a wait without interruption report that limitation.
- Quick commands have a multiline editor, explicit target and input preview. Multiline paste requires confirmation. Search/copy, font size, wrapping and quick-dock height are available; browser preferences persist. The outer Sidebar width remains owned by Harness.
- Both file panes independently select the DSH host or an SSH environment. Browser upload/download refers to the browser device. Files and directories can be selected together; SSH-to-SSH copies stream through the DSH host. Upload/download no longer buffer entire files or impose a 2 MiB limit.
- Transfers report bytes/files, cancellation and error/skip/overwrite conflict policies. Tool overwrite requires `overwrite: true`. Two jobs run concurrently, at most 20 are pending/running and 50 recent records are kept. Jobs are not resumed across restarts. Cancellation removes incomplete staging files, not already completed files/directories. Symlinks/devices are not followed; traversal is limited to depth 32 and 10,000 entries. Remote overwrite requires the atomic rename extension.
- Errors retain phase, code and original causes. Diagnostic export previews a metadata whitelist without credentials, command text, host addresses or terminal content.

## Data Storage

The plugin stores its own data under `$DSH_HOME/remote-ops`:

- `environments/<group>/environments.<group>.json` for environment definitions.
- `quick-commands/<group>/commands.<group>.json` for reusable commands.

Use a Harness credential reference such as `passwordRef` for passwords. The
Sidebar form also accepts an SSH password and stores it through
`credentials.set`; the environment JSON keeps only the reference. A private
key may be referenced by local path.

## Agent tools

Version 0.2.20 exposes environment list/create/update/delete, group management,
terminal
open/send/read/signal/close, multi-target batch execution, quick-command list
and run, SFTP operations, and diagnostics. The system-prompt contribution tells
the model to send a complete command when it is known and to use incremental
terminal feedback only when the current CLI state is genuinely uncertain.

Use `session: "local-cmd"` for the plugin's shared visible local terminal,
not the Harness built-in bash/pwsh tool. For SSH, reuse an explicit session
from the environment list. Sending by environment reuses a unique connection;
multiple connections require an explicit session id.

`remote_terminal_send` waits for fresh output and returns `output`,
`submittedText`, `submit`, `streamId`, `startOffset`, `nextOffset`, `endOffset`,
`hasMore`, `reset`, and `truncated`. The default output page is 16,384 UTF-16
code units, with surrogate pairs kept intact. Old viewport history is omitted
unless `includeViewport: true` is requested. To continue without typing:

```json
{"session":"local-cmd","cursor":546,"streamId":"<streamId from send/read>","waitMs":20000}
```

Pass that object to `remote_terminal_read`, replacing the cursor with the
previous `nextOffset`. Drain `hasMore` before waiting. Omit the cursor for
recent history; explicit `offset`/`count` selects backward line history.
`reset`/`truncated` signals replaced or expired history. Tool output is the
raw terminal stream, including control sequences; the UI renders that stream
through its VT model. A running shell, silence (`inferred_idle`), and timeout
do not prove command completion or success: `completion` remains `unknown`.
Observe actual results before dependent commands. Cancellation interrupts the
foreground process; a wait timeout alone does not kill it.

The terminal status bar distinguishes transport, Agent binding, and the last
tool response range/time. A tool receipt is not proof that a model understood
the output. Enlarged icon controls have tooltips. The quick-command dock
starts collapsed; reading history is preserved across SFTP switches, and new
output offers a jump to the latest line without taking over the scroll position.

The client dependency on `sidebarRight` and `sidebarRightTabs` is optional at
activation time. On older or non-Web DSH profiles the plugin no longer blocks
boot; the Sidebar UI attaches automatically when those services become
available.

## Independent Commands and Workspace State

Use `remote_command_execute(session, command)` for self-contained commands.
It returns separate bounded UTF-8 stdout/stderr, a real exit code when supplied
by the process, duration and truncation flags. It never types into the PTY.
Local execution starts a new shell in the plugin directory; SSH opens an exec
channel on an existing connection with the server-default directory. Neither
inherits the interactive terminal's temporary variables or current directory.
There is no stdin. Timeout/cancellation does not prove a remote process stopped.
Limits: 30 seconds by default, 300 seconds maximum, 64 KiB per output stream by
default, 256 KiB maximum, one active command per target and eight total.

Connections have stable runtime numbers and optional notes. Disconnected tabs
retain their output until dismissed; reconnection is explicit and never replays
commands. Browser windows have separate input identities and require explicit
takeover. Recreated terminal streams require input acknowledgement.

SFTP remembers endpoint, path, sort, scroll and bookmarks per Harness session
in browser storage. Transfer results include per-item state; retries skip
completed items. Overwrite previews show both sizes and timestamps. Tasks,
connection notes and receipts are runtime-only, not cross-restart persistence.

The lightweight terminal supports alternate screens, scroll regions and charset
selection escapes. Full-screen grids do not soft-wrap. The current Harness
local PTY has no runtime resize API: this remains a fixed 160x40 terminal, not
a complete xterm replacement. Actual OS IME behavior requires device testing.
